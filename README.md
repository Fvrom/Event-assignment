## Features that needs to be included

- 5 Animations

- Using Query String Parameter with JavaScript

- Optimizing project using Parcel. 


## Feedback - Agnes 

- Easy to navigate the page
- Nice and subtle animations
- I like how you separate each block with illustrations that overlap
- Clean and structured code!
- The first block of text is a bit hard to read in mobile view, maybe you could add a darker colour behind it so the text pops a bit more.
- Since it is quite long, there could have been a scroll-up function at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, the header could have that function.
- Apart from that, very well done. Awesome job! :)
